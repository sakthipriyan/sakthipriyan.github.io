# Raspberry Pi Benchmarking File IO
## using sysbench, sd card and attached external hard disk
raspberry pi, ntfs, fat, ext, hard disk, sd card, benchmark

### Set up sysbench

* Earlier I used it to benchmark the `cpu` [here](../11/raspberry-pi-2-benchmarking.html).  
* So, I used `sysbench` to benchmark the file system.  
* `sysbench` can be installed using `apt-get`

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install sysbench

### Benchmarking cases

1. HDD - FAT32 mounted at `/mnt/storage/`
2. HDD - NTFS mounted at `/mnt/transfers/`
3. SD CARD - EXT4 mounted at `/`

### Benchmarking Preparation

1. Create directory `benchmark` in all three locations

        mkdir /mnt/storage/benchmark
        mkdir /mnt/transfers/benchmark
        mkdir ~/benchmark

2. Create required test files

        $ cd /mnt/storage/benchmark
        $ sysbench --test=fileio --file-total-size=5G prepare
        sysbench 0.4.12:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

        128 files, 40960Kb each, 5120Mb total
        Creating files for the test...

3. Copy the files to other 2 locations

        cp * /mnt/transfers/benchmark/
        cp * ~/benchmark/

### Benchmark

* Change to required directory.
* Run the benchmark.
* Do this for all 3 cases.

#### Output for all cases shown below.

#### Observation and notes

* HDD - FAT32(2.414Mb/sec) > HDD - NTFS(1.7906Mb/sec) >>>>> SD CARD - EXT4(90.526Kb/sec).
* So, in speed comparison,
    * HDD - FAT32 = 1.35 x HDD - NTFS
    * HDD - FAT32 = 26.67 x SD CARD - EXT4
    * HDD - NTFS = 19.77 x SD CARD - EXT4
* In short, HDD is like 20x faster than SD card.
* As in any benchmark, take this with a pinch of salt.
* I repeated each case couple of times and didn't see much deviation in the overall speed.

### Clean up

* Remove the `benchmark` folders.
* Or may be if you want empty `benchmark` folders, then run `sysbench --test=fileio cleanup` in each folder.

### Hardware and OS

* I was using [Raspberry Pi 1 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/) for this setup.  
* It is running [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/) GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
* Internal HDD - Seagate Barracuda 7200.12, 1TB - connected via USB enclosure.
* SD Card - Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 10
