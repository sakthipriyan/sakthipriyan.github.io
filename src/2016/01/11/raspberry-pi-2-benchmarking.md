### Benchmarking
Benchmarking is done on three computers using `sysbench` and `Fibonacci sequence` program in `Java`.

1. **Raspberry Pi**  
Single core 700MHz, 512MB RAM
2. **Raspberry Pi 2**  
Quad core 900MHz, 1GB RAM
3. **Laptop running Ubuntu 14.04**  
Quad core 2.50GHz, 16GB RAM

### Benchmarking using sysbench
Install sysbench using `sudo apt-get install sysbench`

#### Single threaded benchmark

### Benchmarking using Java
*Note:* See [Raspberry Pi 2 setup](raspberry-pi-2-setup.html) to install `Java`.  
Fibonacci Class shown below is used to benchmark.

	public class Fibonacci {
		public static void main(String[] args){
			Fibonacci fib = new Fibonacci();
			Long out = fib.fib(Long.parseLong(args[0]));
			System.out.println(out);
		}

		public long fib(long n){
			if(n==0L){
				return 0L;
			} else if(n==1L){
				return 1L;
			} else {
				return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
			}
		}
	}

### Conclusion
In one line, Raspberry Pi 2 is much faster than the Raspberry Pi, still it is many folds slower than the traditional laptop/desktop processors.  
I think, If you are looking for 24x7 low cost computer, this is the one.  
Beside, you can do lot of experiments with it, that cannot be done with laptop/desktop easily.
