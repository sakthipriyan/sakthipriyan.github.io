# Powerbot connecting real world to twitter
## via Raspberry Pi using GPIO pins

### Intro
This post is long overdue. Recently, had a chance to present what I did with Raspberry Pi some years back. Powerbot is a fun experiment publishing the status of electricity availability in my home town back when we faced an electricity crisis.

### Why and What

* Back in 2012, we were facing serious load shedding.
* Trying to figure out the time and duration of the load shedding.
* Heard about Raspberry Pi and was looking for an actual use case to buy it.
* That is when I imagined using Raspberry Pi to automatically collect electricity availability and publish it to the world via Twitter!

### System Layout

### GPIO pins
GPIO - General Purpose Input Output pins. We can read/write state. State can be either 1 or 0, purely binary based on the voltage level. 
### Sensor Unit
<img class="ui fluid image"  src="/img/posts/powerbot/circuit.png">

* This is a simple circuit that changes the state of the GPIO_IN_4 using LDR.
LDR - Light Dependent Resistor.
* LED light powered using mains line is placed in front of the LDR.
* 3 wires are connected to Pi. 
* 2 for powering the circuit and one for detecting the state.
	* 3.3 V line.
	* Ground line.
	* GPIO 4.

### Software
* Built using Python. Simple Program would check the status of the electricity every second.
* If there is a change in status, it will trigger generating twitter message.
* Message will be buffered in local as well just in case internet connection goes down.
* I had used Twython client library to connect with Twitter. Even built a wrapper around this to overcome the unstable Internet connection.
* Additionally, the software would publish the stats of the electricity over last day, week, month, quarter etc.,
* Entire source code available at [https://github.com/sakthipriyan/powerbot](https://github.com/sakthipriyan/powerbot)

Following code is used to set up and detect the status.

	import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
	
	def init_sensor():
	    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
	    GPIO.setup(4, GPIO.IN)
	
	def get_status():
	    return not GPIO.input(4)


### Twitter
Let’s revisit what happened on the Feb 26, 2013.

Apparently, latest tweets in the account has some issues probably due to hardware malfunctions.

### In retrospect
* I truly enjoyed it!
	* Doing electrical wiring, taking out the electrical wiring out of the switch box.
	* Identifying the electronic components and soldering it to the board.
	* Writing the software to read the GPIO pins.
	* Tweet it out to the whole world the status of electricity in my hometown.
* I still missed the original goal of predicting the load shedding. :( 
* It would have been real fun if powerbot tweeted the ON/OFF time before it happened.
* At least one of my friend from other part of the town started following this twitter handle to check if I had electricity in my home. :)
* I did powerbot, before the IoT became famous. It happened in early 2013. Loooooong time back.
