<p>This is the file used in previous post, where, at the end we had single feature engineered DataFrame.</p>
<p>At the end we will add storeDF method</p>
<pre><code>def storeDF(dataFrame: DataFrame, path: String) = {

}

<p>In the main method, we will store the moviesFeaturedDF at the end.</p>
<pre><code>val moviesFeaturedFile = &quot;../../../Downloads/ml-latest-small/movies-featured.csv&quot;
storeDF(moviesFeaturedDF.repartition(1), moviesFeaturedFile)

<p>We are repartitioning it so that it is stored as a single file. We shouldn&rsquo;t do this in most of the cases.</p>
