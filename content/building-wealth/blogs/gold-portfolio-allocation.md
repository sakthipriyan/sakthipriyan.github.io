Gold has been a store of value for centuries. In modern portfolios, it serves as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation while providing diversification benefits.

## Why Include Gold?

### Portfolio Benefits
- **Inflation hedge**: Gold typically maintains purchasing power over long periods
- **Diversification**: Low correlation with stocks and bonds
- **Crisis protection**: Tends to perform well during economic uncertainty
- **Currency hedge**: Protection against currency devaluation

## Optimal Allocation

Most financial advisors recommend:
- **5-10%** for conservative portfolios
- **10-15%** for moderate risk portfolios
- **15-20%** for aggressive diversification strategies

## Investment Options in India

### 1. Physical Gold
- Coins and bars from certified dealers
- Jewelry (though less liquid)

### 2. Gold ETFs
- Easy to buy/sell like stocks
- Lower storage costs
- Good liquidity

### 3. Gold Mutual Funds
- Professional management
- SIP option available
- Fund of funds investing in Gold ETFs

### 4. Digital Gold
- Fractional ownership
- Safe storage by providers
- Easy to convert to physical form

## Timing Your Gold Investments

Rather than timing the market, consider:
- **Regular SIPs** in Gold ETFs/Mutual Funds
- **Rebalancing** annually to maintain target allocation
- **Dollar-cost averaging** for better average prices

## Tax Implications

- **Short-term gains** (< 3 years): Taxed as per income slab
- **Long-term gains** (> 3 years): 20% with indexation benefits

Gold should be part of a well-diversified portfolio, not the entire strategy. Balance is key!
