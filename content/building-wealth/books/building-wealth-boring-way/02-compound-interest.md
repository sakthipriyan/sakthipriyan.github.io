## Understanding Compound Interest

Albert Einstein allegedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world." Whether he said it or not, the sentiment is absolutely true. Compound interest is the interest earned on both your initial investment and the accumulated interest from previous periods.

## The Formula

The basic formula for compound interest is:

```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = Final amount
P = Principal (initial investment)
r = Annual interest rate (decimal)
n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
t = Time in years
```

## Real-World Example

Let's say you invest ₹10,000 per month starting at age 25, with an average annual return of 12%:

- **At age 35** (10 years): ₹23.2 lakhs
- **At age 45** (20 years): ₹99.9 lakhs
- **At age 55** (30 years): ₹3.5 crores
- **At age 60** (35 years): ₹6.4 crores

The same investment starting at age 35 would give you only ₹2.3 crores at age 60. That's the power of starting early!

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start Early**: Every year counts
2. **Be Consistent**: Regular investments compound faster
3. **Stay Patient**: Time is the secret ingredient
4. **Reinvest Returns**: Don't withdraw your earnings

## The Boring Truth

There's no shortcut to compound interest. It requires:
- Time
- Patience
- Consistency
- Discipline

But the results are worth it. This is the foundation of boring wealth building.
