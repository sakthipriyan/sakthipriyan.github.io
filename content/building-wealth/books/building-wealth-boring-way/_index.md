## Key Principles

This book is built on time-tested principles:

1. **Start Early**: Time is your biggest advantage
2. **Invest Consistently**: Automate to remove emotion
3. **Diversify Globally**: Don't put all eggs in one country
4. **Keep Costs Low**: Index funds over active funds
5. **Stay Disciplined**: Ignore market noise
6. **Think Long-Term**: 20-30 year horizon
7. **Rebalance Annually**: Maintain target allocation
8. **Protect First**: Insurance and emergency funds before aggressive investing

## The Boring Formula

```
Wealth = (Early Start) × (Consistent Investment) × (Time) × (Compounding) 
         - (Emotion + Lifestyle Inflation)
```

**Maximize**: Early start, consistency, time, compounding  
**Minimize**: Emotional decisions, lifestyle inflation
