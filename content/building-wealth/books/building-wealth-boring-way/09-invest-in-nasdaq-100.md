## Introduction

If you're serious about building wealth, you cannot ignore international diversification. And when it comes to international equity, the NASDAQ 100 stands out as one of the most powerful wealth-creation engines in history.

This chapter explains why and how to invest in NASDAQ 100 from India.

## What is NASDAQ 100?

### The Index

**NASDAQ 100** is an index of the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in the United States.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Technology-heavy**: ~50% tech companies
- **Growth-focused**: High-growth companies
- **Top-heavy**: Top 10 companies = ~50% of index
- **No financials**: Excludes banks and financial institutions

### Top 10 Holdings (as of 2025)

| Rank | Company | Sector | Weight |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | NVIDIA | Semiconductors | ~8% |
| 2 | Apple | Technology | ~8% |
| 3 | Microsoft | Software | ~8% |
| 4 | Alphabet (Google) | Internet | ~6% |
| 5 | Amazon | E-commerce/Cloud | ~5% |
| 6 | Meta (Facebook) | Social Media | ~4% |
| 7 | Broadcom | Semiconductors | ~4% |
| 8 | Tesla | Electric Vehicles | ~3% |
| 9 | Costco | Retail | ~2% |
| 10 | Netflix | Streaming | ~2% |

**Top 10 Weight**: ~50%  
**Remaining 90 companies**: ~50%

### Why NASDAQ 100 Matters

**Historical Performance** (20+ years, in INR):

| Period | USD Performance | INR Depreciation | Total (INR) |
|--------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| 2011-2025 | ~18% CAGR | ~5% per year | **~24% CAGR** |

**Example**: ₹5,627 invested on 1 Apr 2011 → ₹1,29,714 on 3 Nov 2025

**Compare with India**:
- NASDAQ 100 (INR): 24% CAGR
- Nifty Next 50: 14% CAGR
- Nifty 50: 12% CAGR

**The Gap**: Over 20 years, this difference is massive:
- ₹10L in NASDAQ → ₹2.3 crores
- ₹10L in Nifty 50 → ₹98 lakhs
- **Difference**: ₹1.32 crores!

## Why Invest in NASDAQ 100?

### 1. Geographical Diversification

**Risk Concentration**:
- Investing only in India = 100% exposure to Indian economy
- India GDP = ~$3.5 trillion
- US GDP = ~$27 trillion
- Global GDP = ~$100 trillion

**What If**:
- India-specific recession?
- Regulatory changes affecting Indian markets?
- Political instability?

**Solution**: Diversify across geographies.

### 2. Currency Diversification (Hedge)

**INR vs USD** (historical trend):

| Year | USD/INR | Depreciation |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 2011 | ₹44 | - |
| 2015 | ₹65 | -32% |
| 2020 | ₹75 | -41% |
| 2025 | ₹89 | -51% |

**Average**: ~4-5% depreciation per year

**Impact on NASDAQ Returns**:
- NASDAQ return in USD: ~18%
- INR depreciation: ~5%
- **Total return in INR: ~24%**

**This is a hedge**: Even if NASDAQ gives 0% return in USD, you gain from currency!

### 3. Access to Global Leaders

**Companies You Use Daily**:
- Search: Google (Alphabet)
- Social Media: Facebook, Instagram (Meta)
- Shopping: Amazon
- Streaming: Netflix
- Phone: Apple iPhone
- Cloud: Microsoft Azure, AWS
- AI: NVIDIA chips power ChatGPT

**Indian Alternative?** Limited. These are global monopolies/oligopolies.

### 4. Technology and Innovation Exposure

**Secular Trends**:
- Cloud Computing (Amazon, Microsoft, Google)
- Artificial Intelligence (NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google)
- Electric Vehicles (Tesla)
- Digital Payments (PayPal, Block)
- Biotechnology (Moderna, Gilead)

**India's Focus**: Services, traditional industries  
**US Tech Focus**: Cutting-edge innovation

Both are important, hence diversify.

### 5. Long-Term Wealth Creation

**NASDAQ 100 Power**:
- 30 years (1995-2025): ~15% CAGR in USD
- With INR depreciation: ~20% CAGR in INR
- ₹1,00,000 invested in 1995 → ₹2.37 crores today

**This compounds**:
- Every year India invests only → misses this growth
- Diversifying 30-40% → captures it

## Risks of NASDAQ 100

### 1. Heavy Tech Concentration

**Risk**: If tech sector crashes, NASDAQ suffers significantly

**Historical Examples**:
- **Dot-com Bubble (2000-2002)**: NASDAQ fell 78%
- **2022 Tech Correction**: NASDAQ fell 33%

**Mitigation**: 
- Don't go 100% NASDAQ
- Balance with Indian equity
- Long-term holding (recovers from crashes)

### 2. Top-Heavy Concentration

**Risk**: Top 10 companies = 50% of index

**What If**: Regulatory action against big tech?

**Example**: Antitrust cases against Google, Meta, Amazon

**Mitigation**: This is index investing—automatic rebalancing happens

### 3. Currency Risk (Double-Edged Sword)

**Usual Case**: INR depreciates → You gain  
**Rare Case**: INR appreciates → You lose

**Example**: ₹65 → ₹60 (INR strengthens)
- NASDAQ +10% in USD
- Currency -7.7%
- **Net**: +2.3% in INR

**Historical Reality**: INR has depreciated consistently for decades. Unlikely to reverse long-term.

### 4. Regulatory and Geopolitical Risks

**Scenarios**:
- US-China trade war affecting tech companies
- Increased regulation on big tech
- Data privacy laws impacting business models

**Mitigation**: Diversification across 100 companies, long-term view

### The Complete Cost Breakdown

**Investment**: ₹50,000/month → NASDAQ 100

| Cost Component | Amount | % |
|----------------|--------|---|
| INR to USD conversion | ~₹500 | 1.0% |
| Transfer charges | ₹500 | 1.0% |
| ETF buying (NAV spread) | ~₹500 | 1.0% |
| Brokerage ($4) | ₹350 | 0.7% |
| ETF TER (annual) | 0.20% | 0.2% |

**First Year Total**: ~4%  
**Subsequent Years**: ~0.2%

**Amortized over 10+ years**: Minimal impact

**Compare**:
- Indian FOF: 0.5-1% every year forever
- Direct: 0.2% every year after first year

## Tax Considerations (TCS)

### TCS (Tax Collected at Source)

**Rule**: If LRS remittance > ₹10 lakhs/year → 20% TCS

**Example**:
- Remit ₹12 lakhs for investment
- TCS: ₹2.4 lakhs (20% of ₹12L)
- **You pay**: ₹14.4 lakhs upfront

**But**:
- TCS is **not a tax**, it's **advance tax**
- Fully adjustable when filing ITR
- Can be adjusted via **Form 12BAA** against salary TDS

### Form 12BAA (Employer TCS Adjustment)

**Old Process**:
- Pay TCS upfront → Wait for ITR filing → Get refund (6-12 months)

**New Process (Form 12BAA)**:
- Submit Form 12BAA to employer
- Employer adjusts TCS against monthly TDS
- No waiting for refund!

**How**:
1. Download Form 12BAA from Income Tax portal
2. Fill details of TCS paid
3. Submit to employer HR/Finance
4. Employer reduces TDS from salary
5. Get TCS money back in monthly salary

**Example**:
- TCS paid: ₹2.4L (Oct 2024)
- Monthly TDS: ₹20,000
- Submit Form 12BAA
- Employer stops TDS for 12 months
- You get ₹20,000 extra in salary each month

## Tax Filing (ITR-2)

### Additional Schedules Required

**Schedule FA** (Foreign Assets):
- Disclose IBKR account
- Disclose ETF holdings
- Value as of 31st Dec

**Schedule FSI** (Foreign Source Income):
- Dividends from US ETF (if any)
- Capital gains on sale

**Why Mandatory?**:
- Black Money Act 2015
- Non-disclosure → Heavy penalties
- Better to comply and sleep peacefully

### Capital Gains Taxation

**STCG** (Holding < 24 months):
- Taxed at slab rate

**LTCG** (Holding ≥ 24 months):
- Taxed at 12.5% without indexation

**Example**:
- Buy: ₹10L worth XNAS
- Sell after 3 years: ₹18L
- Gain: ₹8L
- Tax: ₹8L × 12.5% = ₹1L
- **Net Gain**: ₹7L

### Comparison: Direct vs Indian MF

| Aspect | Direct US ETF | Indian MF |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Expense Ratio** | 0.20% | 0.5-1.0% |
| **Tax (LTCG)** | 12.5% | 12.5% |
| **Filing Complexity** | High (FA, FSI) | Low |
| **TCS Impact** | Yes (>₹10L) | No |
| **Access** | Full | Limited/Closed |

**Trade-off**: Higher complexity vs lower cost and full access

## My Investment Strategy

### Allocation: 35% of Equity

**Total Equity Portfolio**: 80%

| Geography | Allocation | Instruments |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| India | 45% | Nifty 50, Next 50, Midcap, Smallcap |
| **US (NASDAQ 100)** | **35%** | **XNAS (LSE)** |

### Monthly Process

**Total Investment**: ₹1,00,000/month

**NASDAQ Allocation**: ₹35,000/month

**Execution**:
- Month 1: Skip (accumulate)
- Month 2: ₹70,000 remit + invest
- Repeat

**Why Accumulate**:
- Reduce per-transaction cost
- Fewer TCS events
- Better USD conversion (larger amounts)

### Rebalancing

**Annual Review**:
- If NASDAQ grows to 40-45% → Book partial profit
- If NASDAQ falls to 25-30% → Add more
- Target: Maintain 35% allocation

## Should You Invest in NASDAQ 100?

### Yes, If:

✅ Long-term horizon (10+ years)  
✅ Comfortable with volatility  
✅ Want geographical diversification  
✅ Want currency hedge  
✅ Can handle tax filing complexity  
✅ Believe in US tech growth

### No, If:

❌ Short-term horizon (<5 years)  
❌ Cannot handle volatility  
❌ Uncomfortable with international investing  
❌ Tax filing seems too complex  
❌ Want only simple investments

### Alternative for "No" Cases

- Wait for Indian NASDAQ MFs to reopen
- Invest in Indian tech-focused funds
- Stick to Nifty 50/Next 50/Midcap

## Conclusion: Why I Invest 35% in NASDAQ 100

**Geographic Diversification**: Not dependent on Indian economy alone

**Currency Hedge**: INR depreciation benefits me

**Global Leaders**: Own the companies that run the world

**Long-Term Wealth**: 24% CAGR (INR) over 20 years

**Boring Approach**:
- Monthly investment via LRS
- Buy XNAS on LSE
- Hold for decades
- No timing, no prediction
- Just systematic accumulation

**The Result**: A globally diversified equity portfolio that captures growth from both India and the US, the world's two most dynamic economies.

**Is it worth the complexity?** For me, absolutely yes. For someone just starting, build your India equity base first, then add international later.

But eventually, **ignoring international equity means leaving significant wealth creation on the table.**

That's why NASDAQ 100 is a core part of my boring wealth-building strategy.
