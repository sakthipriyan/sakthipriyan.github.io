### Why It Matters

Traditional portfolio management often ignores:
- **Tax inefficiency** from not optimizing across family members
- **Complexity** of managing multiple investors with different constraints
- **TCS requirements** for international investments from India
- **Rebalancing costs** from frequent buying and selling

The Intelligent Family SIP Allocator solves all these problems by using **cashflow rebalancing**—directing new investments to underweight assets while respecting all constraints. This approach is:
- **Tax-efficient**: No capital gains from selling
- **Systematic**: Monthly discipline keeps allocation on track
- **Compliant**: Automatic TCS tracking for international assets
- **Optimal**: Smart allocation logic minimizes drift over time

### Who Should Use This

This tool is ideal for:
- Families investing together across multiple members
- Investors with international equity exposure (US, developed markets)
- Those seeking tax optimization across different income brackets
- Anyone wanting disciplined, systematic portfolio rebalancing
- DIY investors managing their own asset allocation
