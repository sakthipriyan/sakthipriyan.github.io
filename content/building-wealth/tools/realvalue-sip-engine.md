## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Why does RealValue SIP Engine show lower portfolio values than other SIP calculators?

**Short Answer**: RealValue SIP Engine uses mathematically accurate monthly compounding, while many popular SIP calculators use an oversimplified calculation method that inflates returns.

**Technical Explanation**:

Most online SIP calculators incorrectly calculate monthly returns by simply dividing the annual CAGR by 12. For example, if you input 12% annual CAGR, they use 1% per month (12% ÷ 12).

**The Problem**: This is mathematically incorrect because it doesn't account for compound interest properly.

**The Correct Approach** (used by RealValue SIP Engine):

To convert annual CAGR to monthly compounding rate:
```
Monthly Rate = (1 + Annual CAGR)^(1/12) - 1
```

For example, with 12% annual CAGR:
- **Incorrect method**: 12% ÷ 12 = 1% per month
- **Correct method**: (1.12)^(1/12) - 1 = 0.9489% per month

**Real Impact Example**:

For a ₹10,000 monthly SIP for 20 years at 12% CAGR:
- **Incorrect calculation**: Results appear ~1-2% higher
- **Accurate calculation** (RealValue): Shows mathematically correct future value

This difference becomes more significant with:
- Higher CAGR rates
- Longer investment periods
- Larger investment amounts

**Why This Matters**:

1. **Realistic Expectations**: You get accurate projections, not inflated ones
2. **Better Planning**: Plan based on what you'll actually get, not marketing numbers
3. **Financial Discipline**: Avoid disappointment when actual returns don't match calculator predictions

**Additional Accuracy Features in RealValue**:

Beyond accurate compounding, RealValue also:
- Applies inflation adjustments to show real purchasing power
- Factors in exit taxation on gains
- Accounts for SIP step-ups accurately
- Shows both nominal and real (inflation-adjusted) values

> **Bottom Line**: If another SIP calculator shows higher values than RealValue for the same inputs, it's likely using oversimplified math. RealValue prioritizes accuracy over impressive-looking numbers.
