### 1️⃣ Credit Card 💳 / How it works

- Merchants typically pay **MDR** (1–3%) to banks + card networks + payment processors 
- Banks pass ~1% back to you as cashback 
- Merchants often raise prices slightly to absorb MDR
- Bill generated monthly on a specific date (Nov 28)
- Payment due date is N days from bill generation (Dec 18)

--

### 1️⃣ Credit Card 💳 / Downsides
- Banks often offer credit limits as multiples of monthly income and <br/>offer LTF/FYF cards
  - Higher spending → more MDR income 
  - More chances of EMI usage 
  - Higher interest income when customers revolve balances
- Very high annual interest rates of 30 – 48%
  - Missing full payment: massive cost & credit score impact
  - Even small outstanding becomes expensive in months
- Interest applies to the entire outstanding amount from the transaction date if the full bill is not paid by due date.
- Minimum due trap: paying only minimum can keep you in debt for years
