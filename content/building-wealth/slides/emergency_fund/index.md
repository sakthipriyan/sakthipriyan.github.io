### 1. Emergency Fund

#### Why?

**Because life is uncertain 💡**

- Job loss or business slowdown  
- Medical emergency 
- Peace of mind — knowing you're covered  
- Building block for equity investing

--

#### How Much to Keep?

**Rule of thumb 🧮**

- **Basic safety:** 3–6 months of expenses  
- **Ideal safety:** 12 months — especially for families or self-employed  

**🛋️ Comfort and Opportunity cost ⏳**
- More months, we end up losing compounding on long-term wealth building. 
- For me, **12 months** feels ideal for peace of mind

--

#### Where to Keep?

- Cash in hand
- Bank
    - Savings Account
    - Sweep-in Fixed Deposit
- Mutual Funds
    - Debt: **Liquid Fund**
    - Debt: Ultra Short Duration Fund
    - Debt: Short Duration Debt Fund
    - Hybrid: **Arbitrage Fund**
    - Hybrid: **Conservative Hybrid Fund**

### 3. Handling Emergencies

Emergencies usually fall into two major categories:

1. **Medical Emergency 🏥**  
2. **Job Loss or Income Interruption 💼**

--

#### Handling a Medical Emergency

Step-by-step approach to manage liquidity smartly:

1. **Health Insurance Policy** — first line of defense 🛡️  
2. **Use Credit Card** — short-term buffer for timing gap 💳  
3. **Redirect Next Month's Investments** — temporarily pause investments/SIPs  
4. **Redeem from Liquid Fund** — instant access to cash 💧  
5. **Redeem Hybrid Fund(s)** — only if required after above steps 🧱  

> 💡 *The goal is to keep the emergency fund last in the chain — not first.*

--

#### Handling a Job Loss

1. **Reassess Expenses:** Contain all discretionary spending  
2. **Monthly Redemptions:**  
   - Withdraw 1 month’s expense from **Liquid Fund**  
   - After 2 months, start partial redemptions from **Hybrid Fund(s)**  
3. **Maintain Financial Stability:** Ensure essential expenses are covered while minimizing risk to remaining investments  

> 💡 *Treat your emergency fund as a personal salary continuity plan.*

--

#### Rebuilding Emergency Fund

- **Restart contributions immediately** once regular income resumes  
- **Prioritize liquidity first:** Refill Liquid Fund portion before hybrids  
- **Gradual top-up:** Restore hybrid allocations over multiple months to rebuild full coverage  
- **Maintain target months:** Keep 12 months (or your chosen comfort level)

> 💡 *The goal is to always have the emergency fund ready for future contingencies.*
