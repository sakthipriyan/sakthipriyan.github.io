<p>You need to complete <a href="../../../2018/12/06/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning-models-using-scala-spark.html">Feature engineering for machine learning models</a> before proceeding.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>HandsOn2.scala</h3>
<p>This is the file used in previous post, where, at the end we had single feature engineered DataFrame.</p>
<p>At the end we will add storeDF method</p>
<pre><code>def storeDF(dataFrame: DataFrame, path: String) = {
  dataFrame.write.option("header", "true").csv(path)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the main method, we will store the moviesFeaturedDF at the end.</p>
<pre><code>val moviesFeaturedFile = "../../../Downloads/ml-latest-small/movies-featured.csv"
storeDF(moviesFeaturedDF.repartition(1), moviesFeaturedFile)
</code></pre>
<p>We are repartitioning it so that it is stored as a single file. We shouldn't do this in most of the cases.</p>
<h3>Let's inspect the output</h3>

Without repartition, it might have been multiple files as output.</p>
<h3>HandsOn3.scala</h3>
<p>Let's move on to the building the machine learning models now.</p>
<p>Following is the scala source code for <code>HandsOn3.scala</code>.<br />
We will be writing all the new steps into the <code>def main(args: Array[String])</code> </p>

<h4>Let's create train and test</h4>
<pre><code>def trainAndTest(df:DataFrame, features: Array[String]): (DataFrame,DataFrame) = {

  // Data Transformation
  val assembler = new VectorAssembler().setInputCols(features).setOutputCol("features")

  // Only movieId, features, label selected here.
  val data = assembler.transform(df).select("movieId","features","label")

  // Split the data into train and test
  val splits = data.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2), seed = 1234L)
  val train = splits(0)
  val test = splits(1)

  // Return train and test as Tuple
  (train,test)
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>We will use <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/ml-features.html#vectorassembler">VectorAssembler</a> to transform the input as required by most Machine Learning models in Spark.</li>
<li>We will use <code>data.randomSplit</code> to split input dataFrame into train and test.</li>
</ul>
<h4>In main method</h4>
<pre><code>val features = Array("gCount","tCount", "Drama")
val (train,test) = trainAndTest(moviesFeaturedDF, features)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>List of features used for training the model.</li>
<li>In this case, I had picked <code>gCount</code>, <code>tCount</code> and <code>Drama</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Machine Learning Model</h3>
<p>We will go through <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/ml-classification-regression.html#multilayer-perceptron-classifier">Multilayer perceptron classifier</a> machine learning models as part of this post.</p>
<h4>Multilayer perceptron classifier (MLPC)</h4>
<p>Multilayer perceptron classifier (MLPC) is a classifier based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network">feedforward artificial neural network</a>.</p>
<h4>Train MLPC model using given features and train DataFrame</h4>
<pre><code>def trainMLPC(train:DataFrame, features: Array[String]) : MultilayerPerceptronClassificationModel = {

  // Setting up Hyper Parameters. Specify layers for the neural network:
  // Input layer of size (features.length), 
  // Two intermediate layers of size (features.length + 2) and (features.length + 1)
  // Output of size 4 (classes)
  val layers = Array[Int](features.length, features.length + 2, features.length + 1, 4)

  // create the trainer and set its parameters
  val trainer = new MultilayerPerceptronClassifier()
    .setLabelCol("label")
    .setFeaturesCol("features")
    .setLayers(layers)
    .setBlockSize(128)
    .setSeed(1234L)
    .setMaxIter(100)

  // This would train the MultilayerPerceptronClassifier for the given data and hyper parameters.
  trainer.fit(train)
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>In the <code>layers</code> we can change the intermediate hidden layers</li>
<li>Next we have to invoke this one in main.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Train MLPC using train dataset and selected features</h4>
<p>In the main, add following.</p>
<pre><code>val mlpcModel =  trainMLPC(train,features)
</code></pre>
<h4>Let's test the model for accuracy.</h4>
<pre><code>// Here, we apply the MLPC model built using train data on the test dataset.
val resultMLPC = mlpcModel.transform(test)

// This method detailed below will print the accuracy of the model on the test data.
printAccuracy(resultMLPC)
</code></pre>
<p>Following is the <code>printAccuracy</code> that will print the accuracy of the model by comparing the actual vs predicted class.</p>
<pre><code>def printAccuracy(dataFrame: DataFrame, features: Array[String]): Unit = {
  val predictionAndLabels = dataFrame.select("prediction", "label")
  val evaluator = new MulticlassClassificationEvaluator().setMetricName("accuracy")
  println("Accuracy = " +
    s"${(100 * evaluator.evaluate(predictionAndLabels)).formatted("%.2f")}%" +
    s" Features: ${features.mkString(", ")}. ")
}
</code></pre>

As you can see, this one has given most accuracy so for.</p>
<h3>Next</h3>
<p>In next post, we can simplify this problem to binary classification instead of multi class classification. We will be using both <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/ml-classification-regression.html#random-forest-classifier">Random forest classifier</a> and <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/ml-classification-regression.html#multilayer-perceptron-classifier">Multilayer perceptron classifier</a> machine learning models to compare against each other.</p>
